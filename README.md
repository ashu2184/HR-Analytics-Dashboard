# Key Insights and Features
The organisation has a total of 1470 employees, with 237 employees leaving, indicating a significant attrition pattern.

The attrition rate is 16.12%, which signals potential areas requiring attention from HR leaders.

Male employees (882) are higher in count compared to female employees (588), showing a gender imbalance in workforce distribution.

Employees with Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees contribute the majority to the workforce, while high school and doctoral-level employees form a smaller portion.

Sales and HR departments reveal the highest attrition levels, suggesting job pressure or dissatisfaction in these areas.

The Laboratory Technician, Sales Executive, and Research Scientist job roles show considerable attrition, as displayed in the treemap visualization.

The 25–34 age group records the highest attrition count, indicating younger employees tend to switch jobs more frequently.

Single employees show more attrition than married ones, providing insights into personal lifestyle impact on job stability.

The average job satisfaction score is 3.3, showing moderate engagement levels among employees.

# Why This Project Stands Out

This HR Analytics Dashboard stands out because it transforms raw HR data into meaningful, interactive, and visually appealing insights using only Microsoft Excel. Unlike basic Excel reports, this dashboard brings together multiple HR KPIs in a single, easy-to-navigate interface that even non-technical users can understand. It demonstrates how powerful Excel can be when used with Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, and Slicers to build a complete data analysis solution without requiring any coding or advanced BI tools.

The project also highlights real HR challenges such as attrition, demographic patterns, employee distribution, and job role analysis—making it highly relevant for HR professionals, data analysts, and students. The use of modern visuals, clean layout, and intuitive design ensures that users can quickly identify trends, spot problem areas, and make data-driven decisions.

What makes this project even more unique is its professional dashboard quality, created using tools available to everyone. It serves as an excellent portfolio piece for showcasing skills in data visualization, HR analytics, Excel reporting, and analytical thinking. The project reflects practical real-world scenarios, making it beneficial for learning and presenting during interviews or academic work.

Overall, the dashboard stands out because it combines simplicity, interactivity, practical insights, and strong visual design—all within a single Excel file.
